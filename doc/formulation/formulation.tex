\begin{abstract}


    In this paper, we introduce a new verification problem with temporal
    logic specifications for a wide range of linear partial differential equations. 
    We leverage the finite
    element method (FEM) to reduce the problem to a verification problem for
    discrete-time linear systems. The specifications are formalized using an
    extension of signal temporal logic (STL).
    A conservative procedure to reformulate the specification into a
    regular STL formula as part of the FEM reduction is also presented. A
    mixed-integer linear encoding is then used to solve the verification problem
    for a given set of initial values and boundary conditions.
    We illustrate the algorithm on one-dimensional heat and wave equations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Partial differential equations (PDEs) model nearly all of the physical systems
and processes of interest to scientists and engineers. Some well-known examples
include the Navier-Stokes equation for fluid mechanics, the Maxwell equations
for electromagnetics, the Schr√∂dinger equation for quantum mechanics, the heat
equation and the wave equation. The analysis of these and other PDEs has had a
tremendous impact on society by enabling our understanding of thermal,
electrical, fluidic and mechanical processes.

While a mature field, the study of PDEs is often approached from a simulation
angle, in which approximate models obtained through spatio-temporal
discretization techniques, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM)
\cite{hughes_finite_2000}, are numerically integrated. These methods, however,
do not allow for rigorous guarantees that a system satisfies a complex
specification. 

The formal statement of specifications and the development of
analysis techniques that can guarantee their satisfaction by design has been the main
focus of the formal methods field. During the past decades, many specification
languages have been defined, such as Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL) \cite{gerth_simple_1996}, Computational Tree Logic (CTL)
\cite{clarke_automatic_1986}, Bounded Linear Temporal Logic 
(BLTL) \cite{jha_bayesian_2009}, Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) \cite{luo_using_2016} 
Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL) \cite{AkVaBe-ICRA-2016} and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) 
\cite{donze_robust_2010}. Originally, these logics have been applied to the
study of finite systems, although more recently the robotics community has
developed abstraction procedures to reduce problems with Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to finite models (for example through state space
discretization \cite{kloetzer_fully_2008} or mixed-integer linear program (MILP) encodings
\cite{raman_model_2014}).
However, these techniques cannot be immediately applied to the analysis of PDEs.
In this work, we extend STL to allow
specifications over the solutions of PDEs in such a way that both temporal and
spatial properties can be formally stated. Then, we formulate and solve the problem 
of verifying a PDE against a property in our extension to STL. We consider verification
for both singletons and sets of initial values and boundary conditions.
To the best of our knowledge, the verification 
of temporal properties in systems governed by PDEs has not been explored before.

% In order to use these formalisms for verification, a
% suitable model of the system is required, such as finite models obtained through
% abstraction procedures (typically for LTL and CTL), or mixed-integer linear
% encodings (for example for STL) 


% Such specifications are typically expressed in formal languages
% such as temporal logics, which have been a popular choice in the fields of
% robotics, synthetic biology or traffic networks. Their appeal comes from 
% their ability to specify time-related
% properties, the availability of verification algorithms, and their resemblance
% to natural language.

% These specifications are typically expressed in formal languages
% that ensure the specification has a non-ambiguous meaning while being expressive
% enough to capture many different behaviors of the system. 
% Among these, temporal logics have enjoyed some
% popularity in the fields of robotics, synthetic biology or traffic networks,
% besides their original use for digital circuits and computer programs. The
% appeal of these formalisms comes from their ability to specify time-related
% properties, the availability of verification algorithms, and their resemblance
% to natural language.

% In the analysis of many engineering problems, it is important to determine
% whether, subject to a range of initial and boundary conditions, the system of
% interest satisfies certain constraints, or operates within desirable performance
% bounds. When the complexity
% and diversity of these properties increase, it is useful to state them in
% formal languages  that ensure the specification has a
% non-ambiguous meaning while being expressive enough to capture many different
% behaviors of the system. Among these, temporal logics have enjoyed some
% popularity in the fields of robotics, synthetic biology or traffic networks,
% besides their original use for digital circuits and computer programs. The
% appeal of these formalisms comes from their ability to specify time-related
% properties, the availability of verification algorithms, and their resemblance
% to natural language.

% Many different temporal logics have been proposed tailored to different kinds of
% temporal properties: Linear Temporal
% Logic (LTL) \cite{gerth_simple_1996} and Computational Tree Logic (CTL) \cite{clarke_automatic_1986} 
% consider linear- and branching-time
% properties over infinite time horizons; Bounded Linear Temporal Logic 
% (BLTL) \cite{jha_bayesian_2009}, Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) \cite{luo_using_2016} 
% and Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL) \cite{AkVaBe-ICRA-2016} allow
% explicit time constraints; and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) \cite{donze_robust_2010} 
% defines a notion of
% robust satisfaction. In order to use these formalisms for verification, a
% suitable model of the system is required, such as finite models obtained through
% abstraction procedures (typically for LTL and CTL), or mixed-integer linear
% encodings (for example for STL) \cite{sadraddini_robust_2015}.

% Many different temporal logics have been proposed tailored to
% different kinds of verification problems and systems. Linear Temporal Logic
% (LTL) \cite{gerth_simple_1996} and Computational Tree Logic (CTL)
% \cite{clarke_automatic_1986} have been widely used to verify
% linear- and branching-time properties over infinite time horizons. Probabilistic
% versions have been defined and used when verification is considered in a
% probabilistic way. For those applications that require explicit time
% constraints, such as scheduling or motion planning, we may express properties
% using Bounded Linear Temporal Logic (BLTL) \cite{jha_bayesian_2009}, Metric
% Temporal Logic (MTL) \cite{luo_using_2016}, 
% or Time-Window Temporal Logic (TWTL) \cite{AkVaBe-ICRA-2016}. We may additionally be interested in more
% than a binary answer to the verification problem, such as how robustly our
% system satisfies the specification. In this case, Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
% \cite{donze_robust_2010}
% admits quantitative semantics that corresponds to the distance of the system
% trajectory to the boundary of satisfaction.
%
% In order to formulate a verification problem using a temporal logic, a suitable
% model of the system is required. In the case of LTL and CTL, a finite model is
% obtained either directly (e.g., for electrical circuits) or through
% an abstraction process (e.g., when dealing with dynamical systems described with
% differential equations). For the bounded time logics, a full trajectory is
% needed, which can present a problem when we attempt to verify the behavior of a
% system for a set of initial conditions. One can overcome this issue by using 
% a mixed-integer linear encoding of the specification plus the system dynamics in
% the case of linear systems \cite{sadraddini_robust_2015}.


% Even though there exists a theory on the often related problem of optimal
% control for PDEs (see \cite{lions_optimal_1971}), to the best of our knowledge, the verification 
% of temporal properties in systems governed by a PDE has not been explored before.

Our approach uses the FEM to
approximate the trajectory of the PDE by an interpolation of the solution of a
system of ODEs. The FEM is a well-established
numerical method to obtain approximate numerical solutions to PDEs, and is particularly
well-suited to problems with complicated
geometries where exact solutions cannot be found. The state space of the
resulting ODE system represents the field values of the PDE at discrete 
locations, called nodes, obtained after discretizing the domain.
In the process of approximating the PDE trajectory by the FEM model and then
discretizing it both in space (considering only the values at the nodes) and time, 
we define a conservative
reformulation of the specification that follows the same approximation and
discretization steps. In order to account for the approximation and
discretization errors, we introduce correction terms in the formula in such a way
that all trajectories satisfying the corrected formula also satisfy the
original one. Finally, we encode the resulting problem into a MILP 
following previously established methods.

% It works by subdividing, or
% discretizing, the domain into small parts (called finite elements), which
% imposes an approximation, typically in the form of a low-order polynomial, in
% the spatial variation of the field variable of interest. The vertices of the
% elements (called the nodes) represent the discrete locations where the unknown
% field variables of interest are to be determined; this ocurs through the
% assembly of all the unknown nodal degrees of freedom into a global system.
% Importantly, the error introduced in moving from a continuous PDE to a discrete
% FEM model can be systematically improved by using more elements to discretize
% the domain of interest.


% Our method requires the PDE to be linear and also that a FEM approximation to
% the PDE can be made. The
% latter assumption is not overly restrictive, as the FEM can be applied to all PDEs 
% of engineering interest, i.e., Maxwell equations for electromagnetics,
% Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, momentum equation for mechanics,
% diffusion and heat equations, and so on. The linear assumption usually constrains the
% physical system to linear material behavior, although this assumption is also
% not overly restrictive as most engineering systems are designed to operate
% within the linear material response regime \cite{}.

Our method requires the PDE to be linear, which usually constrains the
physical system to linear material behavior. However, this assumption is
not overly restrictive as most engineering systems are designed to operate
within the linear material response regime. We also assume 
time-independent boundary conditions, although this can be relaxed.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in
\cref{sec:preliminaries}, we include a summary of the FEM and STL; 
in \cref{sec:signal_temporal_logic_for_pdes} we
define a new formal language based on STL suitable to describe properties of PDE
systems; in \cref{sec:problem_formulation}, we formalize the verification problem
for PDEs; in \cref{sec:formally_correct_discretization_of_pdestl}, we describe
the process of reformulating the PDE verification problem into a discrete-time
linear system verification problem; we solve the verification problem for sets
of initial values and boundary conditions using MILPs in
\cref{sec:verification_of_initial_sets}; we illustrate the performance of our
approach in \cref{sec:examples}; and we conclude in \cref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

\subsection{Finite Element Method}
\label{sec:heat_equation_and_finite_element_analysis}

In this section we provide a brief summary of the Finite Element Method (FEM)
\cite{hughes_finite_2000}.
We present the method applied
to a simplified heat equation, although the same technique can be applied to other
PDEs. 

Let $\Omega = (0, L) \subset \R$ be an open interval representing the interior
of a one-dimensional rod of length $L$; $\rho, c, \kappa > 0$ 
constants denoting density, capacity and conductivity of the rod's material respectively;
$g = (g_0, g_L) \in \R^2$ the (time-independent) boundary conditions at each end of the rod; and $u_0 :
\Omega \rightarrow \R$ an initial value for the temperature on the rod. 
The evolution of the temperature at
each point in the rod can be described by a function $u : \bar \Omega \times [0,
T] \rightarrow \R$, where $T > 0$ denotes the final time and can be infinity and
$\bar \Omega$ is the closure of $\Omega$ (which we call the spatial domain),
such that the following initial boundary value problem (IBVP) is satisfied:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pde}
    \Sigma^{H}(u_0, g) \quad \left \{
    \begin{aligned}
        \rho c \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \kappa \frac{\partial^2
        u}{\partial x^2} &= 0, \text{on } \Omega \times (0, T) \,, \\
        u(0, t) &= g_0, \forall t \in (0, T) \,, \\
        u(L, t) &= g_L, \forall t \in (0, T) \,, \\
        u(x, 0) &= u_0(x), \forall x \in \Omega \,.
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}

An important aspect of the FEM is the creation of a weak formulation of the
governing PDEs in \cref{eq:pde}. The purpose in deriving a weak form is to
reduce the second order spatial derivative of $u$ in \cref{eq:pde} to first
derivatives so that low order (in this case, linear) polynomials can be used to
approximate the field value $u$. Let $D$ be the set of sufficiently smooth 
real-valued functions on $\bar{\Omega} \times (0, T)$ such that all 
$u \in D$ satisfy $u(0, t) = g_0, u(L, t) = g_L, \forall t \in (0, T)$, 
and $V$ a similar set of time
independent functions such that all $w \in V$ satisfy $w(0) = w(L) = 0$. 
The problem is to find $u \in D$ such that for all $w \in V$,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weak_pde}
    \begin{aligned}
        &\int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \kappa \frac{\partial
        u}{\partial x} d \Omega + 
        \int_{\Omega} w \rho c \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} d \Omega = 0 \,, \\
        &\int_{\Omega} w \rho c u(\cdot, 0) d \Omega =
        \int_{\Omega} w \rho c u^0 d \Omega \,. \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
We now obtain an approximate solution to the weak formulation by considering
\cref{eq:weak_pde} with $u$ and $w$ in subspaces of $D$ and $V$.

Let $\{x_i\}_{i = 0}^{n +
1}$, where $x_0 = 0, x_{n+1} = L, x_i \in \Omega, i = 1,...,n$, be a partition of
$\bar\Omega$. Let $d_i(t), i = 0,...,n+1$ represent the
temperature of the rod at node $x_i$, with $d_0(t) = g_0, d_{n+1} = g_L$ and let $d = (d_1, ..., d_n)' \in
\R^n$. We define the following linear node shape function matrices for $i =
0,...,n+1$:
%
\begin{equation}
    N_i(x) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{x - x_{i - 1}}{x_i - x_{i - 1}} & i > 0, x \in [x_{i-1}, x_i] \,, \\
        \frac{x_{i+1} - x}{x_{i+1} - x_{i}} & i < n+1, x \in [x_{i}, x_{i+1}] \,,
    \end{cases} 
\end{equation}
%
which results in the following linear interpolation of the field variable $u$ in
terms of its nodal values $d$:
%
\begin{equation}
    u^d(x, t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} N_i(x) d_i(t) \,.
\end{equation}

Consider the subspaces $D^h \subset D$ and $V^h \subset V$ of linear
interpolations defined above and time-invariant interpolations respectively.
It can be shown that $u^d(x, t)$ is a solution of the weak formulation over the
sets $D^h$ and $V^h$, where $d$ evolves
according to the following linear system:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fem}
    \Sigma^H_{FEM}(u_0, g) \quad \left \{
    \begin{aligned}
        \dot{d} &= A d + b(g) \,, \\
        d_i(0) &= u_0(x_i), \quad i = 1,...,n \,.
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}
%
In the above, $A = -M^{-1}K, b(g) = M^{-1} F(g)$ and $M, K$ and $F$ are the capacity,
stiffness and external force matrices respectively, which are defined as
follows:
%
% \begin{equation}
    \begin{align}
        &M = \frac{\rho c}{6} \begin{pmatrix}
            2 l_0 + 2 l_1 & l_1  & 0 & \cdots \\ 
            l_1 & 2 l_1 + 2 l_2 & l_2  & \cdots \\ 
            0 & l_2 & 2 l_2 + 2 l_3 &  \cdots \\ 
            \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots 
        \end{pmatrix} \,, \label{eq:matrices_M} \\
        &K = \kappa \begin{pmatrix}
            \frac{1}{l_0} + \frac{1}{l_1} & -\frac{1}{l_1}  & 0 & \cdots \\ 
            -\frac{1}{l_1} & \frac{1}{l_1} + \frac{1}{l_2} & -\frac{1}{l_2}  & \cdots \\ 
            0 & -\frac{1}{l_2} & \frac{1}{l_2} + \frac{1}{l_3} &  \cdots \\ 
            \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots 
        \end{pmatrix} \,, \label{eq:matrices_K}\\
        &F(g) = \kappa \begin{pmatrix}
            \frac{g_0}{l_0} & 0 & \hdots & 0 & \frac{g_L}{l_n}
        \end{pmatrix}^\top \,, \label{eq:matrices_F}
    \end{align}
% \end{equation}
%
where $l_e = x_{e+1} - x_e$. As a simplifying assumption, we consider the lumped
version of $M$, which is defined as a diagonal matrix resulting from adding all
elements in each row of $M$. Note that with this assumption, $A$ is a banded
matrix of bandwidth 3. In general, we will denote a PDE by $\Sigma(u_0, g)$
and we will call $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$ the FEM system corresponding to a PDE system
$\Sigma(u_0, g)$.

\subsection{Signal Temporal Logic}
\label{sec:signal_temporal_logic}

% In this section we define a bounded time linear temporal logic suitable to
% formulate specifications for solutions of partial differential equations. We start
% by defining standard Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and then defining a new set of
% predicates over both spatial- and time-varying signals.

In this paper, we base our new specification language for PDEs in Signal
Temporal Logic. An STL formula $\phi$ is defined recursively in the following way:
%
\begin{equation}
    \phi ::= \mu | \lnot \mu | \phi_1 \land \phi_2 | \phi_1 \luntil_{[a,b]}
    \phi_2 \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu$ is a predicate over signals of the form $\mu \equiv \mu(s) > 0$,
$\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are STL formulas,
$\lnot$ and $\land$ are the Boolean operators negation and conjunction, and
$\luntil_{[a, b]}$ is the bounded temporal operator \emph{until}. The satisfaction
of an STL formula at time $t$ for a signal $s :
\R_{\geq 0} \to \R$ is defined recursively as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        s[t] &\models \mu &\iff &\mu(s(t)) > 0 \,, \\
        s[t] &\models \lnot \mu &\iff &\lnot (s[t] \models \mu) \,, \\
        s[t] &\models \phi_1 \land \phi_2 &\iff &s[t] \models \phi_1 \land s[t]
        \models \phi_2 \,, \\
        s[t] &\models \phi_1 \luntil_{[a,b]} \phi_2 &\iff 
            &\exists t' \in [t+a, t+b] \text{ s.t. } s[t'] \models \phi_2 \,, \\
        & & &\land \forall t'' \in [t, t'] s[t''] \models \phi_1] \,.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
A signal $s$ satisfies an STL formula, $s \models \phi$, if and
only if $s[0] \models \phi$. We define other Boolean operators (disjunction,
implication and equivalence) and constants (true and false) in the usual way, 
and the temporal operators
\emph{eventually} and \emph{globally} as $\Event_{[a, b]} \phi \equiv \top
\luntil_{[a,b]} \phi$ and $\Always_{[a, b]} \phi \equiv \lnot \Event_{[a,b]}
\lnot \phi$ respectively.

We also define quantitative semantics for an STL formula over a signal $s$
using the real valued function $r(\phi, s, t)$, which satisfies the property $s[t]
\models \phi \iff r(\phi,s, t) > 0$ and is computed as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        &r(\mu, s, t) &= &\mu(s(t)) \,, \\
        &r(\lnot \mu, s, t) &= &-r(\mu, s,t) \,, \\
        &r(\phi_1 \land \phi_2, s, t) &= &\min\{r(\phi_1,s, t),
    r(\phi_2,s, t)\} \,, \\
    &r(\phi_1 \luntil_{[a,b]} \phi_2,s, t) &= 
    &\max_{t' \in [t+a, t+b]} \biggl\{ \min \bigl\{ r(\phi_2,s, t), \\
    & & &\min_{t'' \in [t, t']}\{r(\phi_1,s, t)\} \bigr\} \biggr\} \,.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
We call $r(\phi,s, t)$ the robustness degree of $s$ with respect to $\phi$ at
time $t$.

\section{Signal Temporal Logic for PDEs}
\label{sec:signal_temporal_logic_for_pdes}

In order to define specifications over the trajectories of PDEs, we extend
regular STL using the following set of predicates:
let $\Lambda$ be a set of predicates over
a set $\bar\Omega$, where each predicate $\lambda \in \Lambda$ is defined as a
tuple $(Q_\lambda, X_\lambda, \mu_\lambda)$, 
and represented using the syntax $Q_\lambda x \in X_\lambda : u(x) - \mu_\lambda(x) >
0$, where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q_\lambda \in \{\forall, \exists\}$ is the spatial quantifier,
    \item $X_\lambda \subseteq \bar\Omega$ is the spatial domain of the predicate and
        we require it to be a closed set, and 
    \item $\mu_\lambda : X_\lambda \to \R$ is a continuous and differentiable function 
        representing the reference profile.
\end{itemize}

We consider STL formulas 
with the previously defined syntax and semantics 
over the set of predicates $\Lambda$, which we call Spatial-STL (S-STL). The satisfaction of a
predicate with respect to a continuous-time signal $u : \bar\Omega \times [0, T]
\to \R$ at time $t \in \R$ is defined as $u[t] \models \lambda \iff 
u(x, t) - \mu_\lambda(x) > 0$ for all $x \in X_\lambda$ if $Q_\lambda = \forall$ or for some $x \in
X_\lambda$ otherwise. We define the quantitative semantics as before with
$r(\lambda,u, t) = \min_{x \in X_\lambda} (u(x, t) - \mu_\lambda(x))$ if $Q_\lambda = \forall$ and
$r(\lambda,u, t) = \max_{x \in X_\lambda} u(x, t) - \mu_\lambda(x))$ otherwise.

\begin{example}
    \label{ex:stl}

    Consider the following formula in S-STL for a heat equation \cref{eq:pde} with a single predicate
    $\lambda = (Q = \forall, X = [8, 9], \mu(x) = -(28x - 192))$:
%
    \begin{equation}
        \psi = \Always_{[1,10]} \forall x \in [8,9] : u(x) - (28x - 192) > 0 \,.
    \end{equation}
%
    The specification reads in natural language: ``Always between 1 and 10 time
    units, at all points $x$ in a rod between lengths 8 and 9, the temperature
    profile $u(x)$ is above $\mu(x) = 28x - 192$."

\end{example}

Throughout this paper, we will use the notation $S(s_0, g) \models \psi$ to denote
that the trajectory of system $S$ (either a PDE system or its corresponding FEM
system) with initial value $s_0$ and boundary conditions $g$ satisfies formula 
$\psi$ (either in regular STL or in S-STL).

\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:problem_formulation}

We can formulate now the S-STL verification problem for a system governed by a
PDE:

\begin{problem}[singleton verification]
\label{pr:stl}
    Given a PDE system $\Sigma(u_0, g)$, with $u_0$ a singleton initial value and $g$
    a singleton boundary condition, and an S-STL formula $\psi$ over a set of
    predicates $\Lambda$, check whether the trajectory of $\Sigma(u_0, g)$
    satisfies $\psi$.
\end{problem}

A more general problem can be formulated if we consider the initial value to be
in a set:

\begin{problem}[set of initial values verification]
\label{pr:stl_set}
    Given a set of initial values $U_0$, where each element $u_0 \in U_0$ is a
    function over the spatial domain of the PDE, a set of PDE systems
    $\{\Sigma(u_0, g) | u_0 \in U_0\}$, with $g$
    a singleton boundary condition, and an S-STL formula $\psi$ over a set of
    predicates $\Lambda$, check whether the trajectory of $\Sigma(u_0, g)$
    satisfies $\psi$ for all $u_0 \in U_0$.
\end{problem}

Finally, we can also formulate a verification problem for PDEs with static
boundary conditions contained in a set:

\begin{problem}[set of boundary conditions verification]
\label{pr:stl_bound_set}
    Given a set of boundary conditions $G$, a set of PDE systems
    $\{\Sigma(u_0, g) | g \in G\}$, with $u_0$
    a singleton initial value, and an S-STL formula $\psi$ over a set of
    predicates $\Lambda$, check whether the trajectory of $\Sigma(u_0, g)$
    satisfies $\psi$ for all $g \in G$.
\end{problem}

Even though the formulation is general for any PDE, in what follows we make the
assumption that the system of ODEs obtained after applying the FEM is linear.
This assumption requires the PDE
to be linear. Additionally, we require in \cref{pr:stl_set} the set of initial
values $U_0$ to be described as a polytope in the parameters of a
linear parameterization of the initial values. For example, the set $\{u(x)
= a x^2 + b | a \in [1,2], b = 5\}$ is acceptable, while $\{u(x) = a^2 x |
a \in [1,2]\}$ is not. Likewise, we require in \cref{pr:stl_bound_set} the set
of boundary conditions $G$ to be a polytope.

In order to solve all three problems, we first reformulate the specification $\psi$
in such a way that it allows us to solve the verification problems
conservatively on a discrete-time linear system instead. This is done in three
steps by considering the FEM approximation to the real solution, a spatial
discretization and a temporal discretization. The solution of \cref{pr:stl}
follows from \cref{th:main} in
\cref{sec:formally_correct_discretization_of_pdestl}. The solution of
\cref{pr:stl_set,pr:stl_bound_set}
involves a reformulation into an optimization problem that can be encoded as a
mixed-integer linear program, which is shown in
\cref{sec:verification_of_initial_sets}.

\section{Discretization of STL for PDEs}
\label{sec:formally_correct_discretization_of_pdestl}

In this section we define a series of reformulations of an S-STL formula over
$\Lambda$ such that satisfaction of each successive reformulation guarantees the
satisfaction of the previous one. A diagram showing the hierarchy of the
reformulations is shown in \cref{fig:diagram}. The theory developed in this section is stated
for a general 1D PDE for ease of notation, alghough it applies to higher dimesional PDEs
with minimal changes.

\begin{figure}[!t]

    \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{diagram.png}
    \caption{Summary of our approach to solve the PDE verification problem.}
    \label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}


We first reformulate the specification $\psi$ so that we can verify instead the
approximation given by $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$. Recall that we denote as $u(x,t)$ the
trajectory of $\Sigma(u_0, g)$ and $u^d(x, t)$ the piecewise linear approximation
obtained by interpolating the trajectory of $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$. In the following, we
assume the partition $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^m$ is proposition preserving with respect 
to the set of
regions $\{X_i\}_{i = 1}^{m}$\footnote{This is well defined since the $X_i$ sets are
closed and there are a finite number of them. In higher dimensions, the
additional requirement that $X_i$ are polytopes is required.}. Suppose we are given
an a priori bound, $\epsilon(x, t)$, for the pointwise difference between them, i.e., 
$|u(x, t) - u^d(x, t)| \leq \epsilon(x, t)$.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:m_perturbation}
    Let $\lambda \in \Lambda$ be a predicate
    and let $f : \bar\Omega \to \R$ be a continuous and differentiable function. The perturbation of
    $\lambda$ by $f$, $\lambda^f$, is the predicate given by the tuple
    $(Q_\lambda, X_\lambda,
    \mu^f_\lambda)$, where $\mu^f_\lambda(x, u) = \mu_\lambda(x, u) + f(x)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:delta_perturbation}
    Let $\psi$ be an S-STL formula over $\Lambda$ in negation normal form 
    and let $\delta : \bar\Omega \to \R$ be a continuous function. The
    conservative correction of $\psi$ by $\delta$, $\psi^\delta$, is an S-STL
    formula in negation normal form obtained by substituting every predicate
    $\lambda$ that appears in $\psi$ in the following way:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\lambda$ is not preceded by a negation operator, then it is
            substituted by $\lambda^{-\delta}$.
        \item Otherwise, it is substituted by $\lambda^{\delta}$
    \end{itemize}

    We will also use $\Lambda^{\delta}$ to refer to the set of all $\delta$ and
    $-\delta$
    corrections of predicates in $\Lambda$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
\label{th:epsilon_approximation}
    If $u^d \models \psi^{\delta}$, with $\delta(x) = \max_t \epsilon(x, t)$, then $u \models \psi$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We only need to consider a predicate $\lambda$ and its negation. We have
    %
    \begin{multline}
        \label{eq:th_epsilon}
         |u(x, t) - \mu_\lambda(x) - u^d(x, t) + \mu_\lambda(x)| = \\
         |u(x, t) - u^d(x, t)| \leq \delta(x) \,.
    \end{multline}
    %
    Thus, $u(x, t) - \mu_\lambda(x) \geq u^d(x, t) -
    \mu_\lambda(x) - \delta(x)$, which proves the result for $\psi = \lambda$. For $\psi
    = \lnot \lambda$, note that satisfaction is equivalent to $u(x, t) -
    \mu_\lambda(x) < 0$ for $x$ quantified opposite to $Q_\lambda$. Then, from
    \cref{eq:th_epsilon} we have $u(x, t) - \mu_\lambda(x) \leq u^d(x, t) +
    \mu_\lambda(x) - \delta(x)$, completing the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    \label{ex:eps_approx}

    Assume we obtain a bound $\delta(x) = 1$ for a heat conduction system
    $\Sigma^H(u_0, g)$ \cref{eq:pde} with $\Omega = (0, 10)$ and its
    FEM approximation. Consider the same specification $\psi$ defined in \cref{ex:stl}.
    The perturbed specification, $\psi^\delta$ is then:
    %
    \begin{equation}
        \psi^\delta = \Always_{[1,10]} \forall x \in [8,9] : u(x) - (28x -
        192) - 1 > 0 \,.
    \end{equation}
    %
    If the FEM approximation to $\Sigma^H(u_0, g)$ satisfies $\psi^\delta$, we can
    conclude $\Sigma^H(u_0, g)$ satisfies $\psi$.
    
\end{example}

Theorem~\ref{th:epsilon_approximation} gives us a way to conservatively solve
\cref{pr:stl} using the approximation obtained from $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$.
However, we still need to deal with continuous functions in continuous time. Our
next step will be to reformulate the problem into a verification problem over
the trajectory of $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$, i.e., $d(t)$.

Let $\Lambda^{\delta}_{FEM} = \{\alpha_{\lambda, e} | \lambda \in
\Lambda^{\delta}, e \in E_{\lambda}\} \cup \{\beta_{\lambda, j} | \lambda \in
\Lambda^{\delta}, j \in J_{\lambda}\}$, where $E_{\lambda} = \{e | [x_e, x_{e+1}] \subseteq
X_{\lambda}\}, J_{\lambda} = \{j | x_j \in X_\lambda, [x_{j-1}, x_j] \not\subseteq
X_\lambda, [x_{j}, x_{j+1}] \not\subseteq X_\lambda \}$,
and satisfaction of $\alpha_{\lambda, e}$ and $\beta_{\lambda, j}$ by 
a continuous-time signal $d : [0, T] \to \R^n$
is defined in the following way:
%
\begin{equation}
    d[t] \models \alpha_{\lambda, e} \iff y_e(t) - 
    \mu_\lambda(\frac{x_e + x_{e + 1}}{2}) > 0 \,,
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
     d[t] \models \beta_{\lambda, j} \iff d_j(t) - \mu_\lambda(x_j) > 0 \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $y_e = \frac{d_e(t) + d_{e+1}(t)}{2}$. The robustness degree for these
predicates is defined as in \cref{sec:signal_temporal_logic}.
Note that this set of predicates includes the perturbations defined in
\cref{def:delta_perturbation}. We define perturbations of predicates in
$\Lambda^{\delta}_{FEM}$ by a real number $k$ in a manner analogous to
\cref{def:m_perturbation}, and we denote it as $\alpha^k$.

\begin{definition} 
\label{def:eta_approximation}
    The STL formula over $\Lambda^{\delta}_{FEM}$, $\psi^{\delta, \eta}_{FEM}$,
    corresponding to an S-STL
    formula in negation normal form, $\psi^\delta$, over $\Lambda^\delta$, with
    $\eta : \bar\Omega \to \R$, is a formula obtained by substituting every
    predicate $\lambda$ in $\psi^\delta$ by the formula $\bigoplus_{e \in
    E_\lambda} \gamma_{\lambda,e} \oplus \bigoplus_{j \in J_\lambda} \beta_{\lambda, j}$, 
    where $\oplus = \wedge$ if $Q_i = \forall$ and $\oplus = \vee$
    otherwise, and $\gamma_{\lambda,e}$ is defined as the following STL formula:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\lambda$ is not preceded by a negation operator, then
            $\gamma_{\lambda, e} = \alpha_{\lambda, e}^{-k_e}$.
        \item Otherwise, $\gamma_{\lambda, e} = \alpha_{\lambda, e}^{k_e}$.
    \end{itemize}

    In both cases, 
    %
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        k_e = \frac{x_{e+1} - x_e}{2} & \left (\max_{c \in [x_e, x_{e+1}]}
        |\mu'(c)| + \max_{c \in [x_e, x_{e+1}]} \eta(c) \right ) \,.
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    %
    We will abuse the notation and use $\psi^{\delta, 0}_{FEM}$ when referring
    to the formula obtained without perturbing the predicates, i.e., both $\eta$
    and $\mu'$ are considered 0.
\end{definition}
% \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(c, t)

\begin{theorem}
\label{th:eta_approximation}
    If $d \models \psi^{\delta, \eta}_{FEM}$, with $\eta(x) \geq \max_t |\frac{\partial
    u^d}{\partial x}(x, t)|$, then $u^d \models \psi^\delta$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We only need to consider a predicate $\lambda$ and its negation. We assume
    $Q_\lambda = \forall$, the other case is similar. Let $X_\lambda = [x_a,
    x_b]$. First note that satisfying $\lambda$ is equivalent to satisfying all
    predicates of the set $\{(Q_\lambda, [x_e, x_{e+1}], \mu_\lambda) | e \in
    E_\lambda\}$. For any $e \in E_\lambda$, let $m = \frac{x_e + x_{e+1}}{2}, 
    h = \frac{x_{e+1} - x_{e}}{2}$. 
    For $x \in [x_e, x_{e+1}]$ we have:
    %
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        &|u^d(x, t) - \mu_\lambda(x) - u^d(m, t) + \mu_\lambda(m)| \leq \\
        &h \max_{c \in [x_e, x_{e+1}]} 
        |\mu'(c) + \frac{\partial u^d}{\partial x}(c, t)| \leq \\
        &h \left (  
        \max_{c \in [x_e, x_{e+1}]} |\mu'(c)| +
        \max_{c \in [x_e, x_{e+1}]} |\frac{\partial u^d}{\partial x}(c, t)|
        \right ) \leq \\
        &h \left (  
        \max_{c \in [x_e, x_{e+1}]} |\mu'(c)| +
        \max_{c \in [x_e, x_{e+1}]} \eta(c)
        \right )  = K_e \,.
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    %
    Then, $u^d(x, t) - \mu_\lambda(x) \geq u^d(m, t) - \mu_\lambda(m) - K_e =
    y_e(t) - \mu_\lambda(m) - K_e$, so $d \models \alpha^{-K_e}_{\lambda, e}$
    implies $u^d \models (Q_\lambda, [x_e, x_{e+1}], \mu_\lambda)$ and the
    theorem holds for $\psi^\delta = \lambda$. To prove it for the negated
    predicate, we can follow an argument similar to the one in the proof of
    \cref{th:epsilon_approximation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    \label{ex:eta_approx}

    Continuing with \cref{ex:eps_approx}, assume we obtained the FEM
    approximation using the partition $\{0.5 i | i \in 0,...,20\}$ and we found the
    bound $\eta(x) = 4$. Note that $|\mu'(x)| = 28$ for all $x$. The perturbed STL
    specification corresponding to $\psi^\delta$ is
    %
    \begin{multline}
        \psi^{\delta, \eta}_{FEM} = \Always_{[1,10]} \bigl(
            (y_{16} - 39 - 1 - k > 0) \land \\ (y_{17} - 53 - 1 - k > 0)
        \bigr) \,,
    \end{multline}
    %
    with $k = \frac{0.5 (28 + 4)}{2} = 8$. If we prove satisfaction of $\psi^{\delta,
    \eta}_{FEM}$ by $\Sigma^H_{FEM}(u_0, g)$, we can conclude the interpolation satisfies
    $\psi^\delta$.
    
\end{example}

Finally, we reformulate the problem into a verification problem over the
trajectory of a time discretization of $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$ with time interval $\Delta
t \in \R_{>0}$. There are several options at this point: the simplest one is to
consider $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$ as a first order linear system (augmenting the state
space if needed) and define the time discretization as the following difference
equation:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:disc_system}
    \Sigma_{FEM}^{\Delta t}(d(0), g) \quad \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde d^{k+1} &= \tilde A \tilde d^k + \tilde b(g) \,, \\
        \tilde d^0 &= d(0) \,,
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}
%
where $\tilde A = e^{A \Delta t}$ and $\tilde b(g) = - e^{A \Delta t} A^{-1} 
( e^{- A \Delta t} - I ) b(g)$. Note that, in theory, $d(k \Delta t) = \tilde d^k,
\forall k \in \N$. However, in practice one needs to numerically compute the
exponential matrices in $\tilde A$ and $\tilde b$, which introduces an
approximation error difficult to control. As an alternative, we can use any
numerical integration algorithm with fixed time step appropriate to the specific
PDE system under study, several of which have been
thoroughly analyzed in the FEM literature, such as the Newmark family. Similar
to the FEM approximation, assume we have a bound on the approximation error of
the integration algorithm, $\max_k |d_j(k \Delta t) - \tilde d^k_j| \leq
\epsilon^d_j, i=1,2,...$.
% We define satisfaction of an STL formula by a discrete time
% signal in a similar way to continuous time. However, we make a slight abuse of
% notation so that the time bounds for the temporal operators should be understood
% in the continuous sense, i.e, $\tilde d[k] \models \Always_{[a, b]} \psi \iff 
% \forall j \in [\frac{a}{\Delta t}, \frac{b}{\Delta t}] \cap \N, \tilde d^{k + j} \models
% \psi$ and similarly with the eventually operator.

We define a conservative correction of $\psi^{\delta, \eta}_{FEM}$ by a real
vector $\nu = (\nu^y, \nu^d)$, $\psi^{\delta, \eta, \nu}_{FEM}$, in a similar
way to \cref{def:eta_approximation}, noting that the predicate $\gamma_{\lambda, e}$ is perturbed
using the constant $l_e^y = \Delta t \nu^y_e$ and the predicate $\beta_{\lambda, j}$ is
perturbed using the constant $l_j^d = \Delta t \nu^d_j$. We abuse the notation
for STL formulas so that we can consider satisfaction of the discrete time
signal $\tilde{d}$. In particular, $\tilde{d}[t] \models \mu \iff
\mu(\tilde{d}^{\lfloor t / \Delta t \rfloor}) > 0$.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{th:nu_approximation}
    If $\tilde d \models \psi^{\delta, \eta, \nu}_{FEM}$, with
    $\nu^d_j = \max_t |\dot d_j(t)| + \epsilon^d_j$ and
    $\nu^y_e = \max_t \frac{|\dot d_e(t)| + |\dot d_{e+1}(t)|}{2} +
    \frac{\epsilon^d_e + \epsilon^d_{e+1}}{2}$, then 
    $d \models \psi^{\delta, \eta}_{FEM}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Similar to \cref{th:eta_approximation}.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    \label{ex:nu_approx}

    Continuing with \cref{ex:eta_approx}, assume we discretize $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$ using
    the timestep $\Delta t = 0.1$ and let $\nu = (5, 5, ...)$. The final
    corrected specification is
    %
    \begin{multline}
        \psi^{\delta, \eta, \nu}_{FEM} = \Always_{[1,10]} \bigl(
            (y_{16} - 39 - 1 - k - \frac{5}{10} > 0) \land \\ 
            (y_{17} - 53 - 1 - k - \frac{5}{10} > 0)
        \bigr) \,.
    \end{multline}
    %
    As before, we can guarantee the satisfaction of $\psi^{\delta,
    \eta}_{FEM}$ by $\Sigma^H_{FEM}(u_0, g)$ if $\Sigma_{FEM}^{H, \Delta t}(u_0, g)$ satisfies
    $\psi^{\delta, \eta, \nu}_{FEM}$.
    
\end{example}

The main result in this work is a corollary of the previous theorems, which
allows us to solve \cref{pr:stl}
conservatively by solving a verification problem for regular STL and discrete-time
linear systems. 

\begin{theorem}
    \label{th:main}
    If $\Sigma_{FEM}^{\Delta t}(u_0, g) \models \psi^{\delta, \eta, \nu}_{FEM}$, with $\delta, \eta$
    and $\nu$ defined as in \cref{th:epsilon_approximation,th:eta_approximation,th:nu_approximation}
    and $d^0_i = u_0(x_i), i = 1,...,n$, then $\Sigma(u_0, g) \models \psi$.
\end{theorem}

We can also obtain a bound for the robustness of the
trajectory of $\Sigma(u_0, g)$ with respect to the original specification 
by making the following observation:

\begin{theorem}
    \label{th:robustness}
    If $u, u^d, d$ and $\tilde{d}$ are trajectories of $\Sigma(u_0, g)$, interpolation
    of $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$, $\Sigma_{FEM}(u_0, g)$ and $\Sigma_{FEM}^{\Delta t}(u_0, g)$,
    respectively, and $\psi$ is an S-STL formula over $\Lambda$, then the 
    following inequality holds:
    %
    \begin{equation}
        r(\psi, u, t) \geq r(\psi^{\delta}, u^d, t) \geq r(\psi^{\delta,
        \eta}_{FEM}, d, t) \geq r(\psi^{\delta, \eta, \nu}_{FEM}, \tilde{d}, t)
        \,.
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    It follows from the proofs of
    \cref{th:epsilon_approximation,th:eta_approximation,th:nu_approximation}.
\end{proof}

Note that our previous analysis can be extended to the time-dependent
boundary conditions case. However, some care must be taken in the
definition of the correction terms (additional corrections must be made on the
boundary nodes) and the time discretization.

\section{Verification for Sets of Initial Values and Boundary Conditions}
\label{sec:verification_of_initial_sets}

In this section we formulate an optimization problem equivalent to
\cref{pr:stl_set,pr:stl_bound_set} which can be converted to a
MILP. This program can then be solved using an off-the-shelf solver such 
as Gurobi \cite{gurobi}.

We can reformulate \cref{pr:stl_set} as the following optimization problem:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:stl_set_opt}
    \begin{aligned}
        &r_m = &\min \quad &r(\psi^{\delta, \eta, \nu}_{FEM}, \tilde{d}, 0) \\
        &  &\text{s.t. } &\cref{eq:disc_system} \\
        &  & &u^{\tilde{d}}(\cdot, 0) \in U_0 \,.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
If $r_m > 0$, then $\psi$ is satisfied for the initial set $U_0$, which provides
a solution for \cref{pr:stl_set}. This
optimization problem is clearly non-convex, due to the $\max$ and $\min$
operators present in the definition of robustness, and the objective function is
non-differentiable. However, we can apply the technique described in
\cite{sadraddini_robust_2015} to
represent robustness as mixed-integer linear constraints. On the other hand, the
system dynamics are linear and we assume the initial set can be represented as
linear constraints over $\tilde{d}^0$. Therefore, \cref{eq:stl_set_opt} is a
MILP.

A solution to \cref{pr:stl_bound_set} can be found with a similar optimization
problem:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:stl_bound_set_opt}
    \begin{aligned}
        &r_m = &\min \quad &r(\psi^{\delta, \eta, \nu}_{FEM}, \tilde{d}, 0) \\
        &  &\text{s.t. } &\cref{eq:disc_system} \\
        &  & &u^{\tilde{d}}(\cdot, 0) = u_0 \\
        &  & &g \in G \,.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
Again, if $r_m > 0$, then $\psi$ is satisfied for the set of initial values
$U_0$, solving \cref{pr:stl_bound_set}. In this case, we need $G$ to be 
a polytope for the previous optimization problem
to be a MILP. Note that we can combine \cref{eq:stl_set_opt,eq:stl_bound_set_opt} in order to
solve a problem with both sets of initial states and sets of boundary
conditions. In general, we can use \cref{eq:stl_bound_set_opt} with any time-independent 
(and time-dependent with some minor adjustments)
parameter in the PDE that appears
as an independent term in the FEM system (with respect to other unknowns). We
present an example in \cref{sub:linear_elasticity} for a second order PDE.

The computational time needed to solve a MILP grows exponentially with 
the number of binary variables. In our encoding, we introduce one
binary variable for each argument to a $\min$ or $\max$ function. Thus, the
number of binary variables is proportional to the length of time intervals (in
the discrete sense), the number of boolean connectives in the original formula
$\psi$ and the length of the discretized predicates obtained in
\cref{def:eta_approximation}. In terms of parameters of the problem and solution,
the length of the discrete-time intervals is proportional to the length of the time
intervals in $\psi$ and inversely proportional to $\Delta t$; regarding the
spatial discretization of the predicates, its length is proportional to the size
of the spatial domains and inversely proportional to the size of the partition
(i.e., the distance between two nodes in the partition).

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

In this section we solve some instances of \cref{pr:stl,pr:stl_set} for a heat
equation and \cref{pr:stl_bound_set} for an elastic wave propagation system and discuss
the conservativeness of our approach as well as the computational performance.
We implemented our framework using Python 2.7 and Gurobi 7.0 as our MILP solver.
We ran our implementation in an Intel Core i7 at 2.4GHz and 8GB RAM.

\subsection{Heat Equation}
\label{sub:heat_equation}

We consider first \cref{pr:stl} for a heat equation \cref{eq:pde}.
Consider a rod with parameters\footnote{For simplicity, we consider all
quantities unitless in this example.} $L = 10, \rho = 1, c =
1, \kappa = 1$, singleton boundary conditions $g_0 = 10, g_L = 100$, singleton initial value $u_0(x) = 20.0$
for $x \in (0, L)$, $u_0(0) = g_0, u_0(L) = g_L$, and the specification from
\cref{ex:stl}, which we restate here:

We show in \cref{fig:ex1_evolution} the trajectory for two mesh sizes along with the
profile in the specification.

        obtained with a finer mesh does not.}
    \label{fig:ex1_evolution}
\end{figure}

Throughout this
section we will consider the true trajectory of the system for some initial
value, $u^*(x, t)$, the solution of the associated FEM system with a uniform mesh of
size $h = 0.01$. We also set $\Delta t = 0.1$ for all time discretizations.

We computed the bound $\delta(x) = \delta$ as the maximum pointwise
error between simulations of the true trajectory and the trajectory for the
given mesh using random initial values of the form $u_0(x) = \min\{\max\{a x +
b, g_0\}, g_L\}$ with $|a| < 2 |g_L - g_0| / L$ and $b \in (0, |g_L - g_0|)$.
Likewise, we determined the bounds $\eta(x)$ and $\nu$ from those simulated
trajectories. We show in \cref{fig:bounds} the resulting bounds for two mesh
sizes.

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering 
    \subfloat[$h = 0.5$]{\label{fig:bounds_a}
        \includegraphics[width=0.48\columnwidth]{pert_plot_N20.png}}
        \hfill
    \subfloat[$ h = 0.2$]{\label{fig:bounds_b}

        \hfill
    \caption{Bounds used for $\delta$, $\eta$ and $\nu$ multiplied by their
    respective coefficients in the correction terms. Note that we show $\nu^d_j$ at
    $x_j$ and use $\nu_e^y = \frac{\nu^d_j + \nu^d_{j+1}}{2}$.}
    \label{fig:bounds}
\end{figure}

The results are shown in \cref{tab:res_meshes}, where the robustness of the
trajectory of the system with respect to each reformulation of the specification
is computed. As expected, finer meshes
yield robustness values closer to the true robustness (-2.7).

\begin{table}

\caption{Varying mesh size robustness results}
\label{tab:res_meshes}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $h$ & $\delta$ & $r(\psi_{FEM}^{0, 0, 0})$ & $r(\psi_{FEM}^{\delta, 0, 0})$ &
    $r(\psi_{FEM}^{\delta, \eta, 0})$ & $r(\psi_{FEM}^{\delta, \eta,
\nu})$ \\
    \hline

    0.2 & 0.24 & -2.74 & -2.94 & -9.10 & -11.27 \\

\end{table}

We checked the validity of our approach as well as the degree of
conservativeness that the corrections add by verifying random initial values
of the previous form. We used for this example a uniform mesh of size $h = 0.2$
and the following specification: 
%
\begin{multline}
    % \begin{aligned}
        \phi = \Always_{[1, 10]} \forall x \in [1, 9]: u(x) - 9x > 0 \ \land \\
        \Event_{[4, 6]} \lnot \exists x \in [6, 7]: u(x) - (9x + 15) > 0 \,,
% \end{aligned}
\end{multline}
%
which reads in natural language: ``Always between 1 and 10 time units, at all
points $x$ in the rod between lengths 1 and 9, the temperature profile $u(x)$ is above the
profile $\mu_1(x) = 9x$. Additionally, eventually between 4 and 6 time units,
there does not exist a point $x$ in the rod between lengths 6 and 7 such that the
temperature profile $u(x)$ is above the profile $\mu_2(x) = 9x + 15$." We depict the
profiles in the specification in \cref{fig:ex2_evolution}, along with two
trajectories.

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering 
    \subfloat[$a = 8.5, b = 10.0$]{\label{fig:ex2_a}
        \includegraphics[width=0.48\columnwidth]{ex2_plots0.png}}
        \hfill
    \subfloat[$a = 5.0, b = 20.0 $]{\label{fig:ex2_b}
        \includegraphics[width=0.48\columnwidth]{ex2_plots1.png}}
        \hfill
        \caption{Two sample trajectories of $u^d(x, t)$ using a mesh of size
        $h=0.2$ and the reference profiles $\mu_1 = 9x$ and $\mu_2 = 9x + 15$.}
    \label{fig:ex2_evolution}
\end{figure}


We show in \cref{fig:res_diffs} the difference between the true robustness and
the robustness for our mesh, both with and without the perturbations. Note that
when we include all perturbations, the computed robustness is less than the true
robustness, as required by \cref{th:main}. Regarding the conservatism of the
approach, we obtained a
difference of at most 5.5 robustness, which would allow us to verify a
specification that is satisfied by at least 5.5 units at all points in a system
that ranges through 90 units. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/cs_ran_init_results.png}

        discretized specification with and without perturbations for
        random initial values.}
    \label{fig:res_diffs}
\end{figure}

Finally, we solved \cref{pr:stl_set} for sets of initial values of the
form $u_0(x) = a x + b$ and the singleton boundary conditions previously stated.
Again, we use a
mesh of size $h = 0.2$. We summarize our results in \cref{tab:res_sets}. We
marked as undefined satisfaction the cases in which the minimum robustness is
negative, since we cannot guarantee their non-satisfaction.

\subsection{Elastic Wave Propagation}
\label{sub:linear_elasticity}

Consider a steel and brass rod of length $L = \SI{100}{\m}$, the section between 
\SI{30}{\m} and \SI{60}{\m} being brass, with densities $\rho_{steel} =
\SI{8e3}{\kg\per\m^3}, \rho_{brass} = \SI{8.5e3}{\kg\per\m^3}$ and Young's
modulus $E_{steel} = \SI{200}{\giga\pascal}, E_{brass} =
\SI{100}{\giga\pascal}$,
with one end fixed and a force $h_L$ applied to the
other end. The displacement $u(x, t)$ of the rod obeys the following
IBVP based on the wave equation:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pde_mech}
    \Sigma^{M}(u_0, h_L) \quad \left \{
    \begin{aligned}
        \rho \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} - E \frac{\partial^2
        u}{\partial x^2} &= 0, \quad \text{on } \Omega \times (0, T) \,, \\
        u(0, t) &= 0, \quad \forall t \in (0, T) \,, \\
        E \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(L, t) &= h_L, \quad 
        \forall t \in (0, T) \,, \\
        % u(L, t) &= g_L, \forall t \in (0, T) \\
        u(x, 0) &= u_0^1(x), \quad \forall x \in \Omega \,, \\
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, 0) &= u_0^2(x), \quad \forall x \in \Omega \,.
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}
%
where $u_0^1, u_0^2$ are the initial displacements and velocities
\footnote{We abuse the notation of the initial value $u_0$, which in this
case has two components $u_0^1$ and $u_0^2$, and the boundary condition, which
in this case is a single scalar which we denote by $h_L$}, and $\rho =
\rho(x), E = E(x)$ are
the density and Young's modulus of the rod at each point.
The corresponding FEM system for linear elements is given by:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fem_mech}
    \Sigma^M_{FEM}(u_0, h_L) \quad \left \{
    \begin{aligned}
        M\ddot{d} + K d &= F + F_{nodal}(h_L) \,, \\
        d_i(0) &= u_0^1(x_i), \quad i = 1,...,n \,, \\
        \dot{d}_i(0) &= u_0^2(x_i), \quad i = 1,...,n \,.
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}
%
where $F_{nodal}(h_L) = (0, 0, ..., 0, h_L)^T$ is the nodal force vector, and $M, K, F$ 
are the mass, stiffness and force matrices, respectively, and
they have the same expressions as in
\cref{eq:matrices_M,eq:matrices_K,eq:matrices_F}, with $c = 1, \kappa =
diag(E(x_i)), \rho = diag(\rho(x_i))$.
For this example, we use the central differences algorithm
\cite{hughes_finite_2000} to obtain a time
discretization with time interval $\Delta t$. 

% The resulting difference equations
% are the following:
% %
% \begin{equation}
%     \Sigma^{M, \Delta t}_{FEM}(d^0, v^0, h_L) \quad \left \{
%     \begin{aligned}
%         \tilde v^{n+1} &= v^n + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t a^n \,, \\
%         \tilde d^{n+1} &= \tilde d^{n} + \Delta t \tilde v^{n+1} \,, \\
%         M a^{n+1} &= F + F_{nodal}(h_L) - K \tilde d^{n+1} \,, \\
%         v^{n+1} &= \tilde v^{n+1} + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t a^{n+1} \,, \\
%         M a^0 &= F + F_{nodal}(h_L) - K d^0 \,. \\
%     \end{aligned}
%     \right.
% \end{equation}

A classical engineering problem related to the safety of this system is to
verify that the maximum displacements at all points in the rod do not exceed a
safe profile. Additionally, we require that at some point in time the load
applied is enough to stretch the rod above a target profile, which may be needed
as part of a manufacturing process such as forming, where the rod has to undergo a shape change. 
The resulting S-STL formula is the following:
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \phi &= & \Event_{[0.0, 0.3]} \big ( & \lnot \exists x \in [35, 55]: u(x) -
        \mu_1(1.5) > 0 \land \\
    & & &\lnot \exists x \in [65, 90]: u(x) - \mu_2(1) > 0 \big)
    \land \\
    & & \Event_{[0.0, 0.3]} \big ( & \forall x \in [35, 55]: u(x) - \mu_1(-1) > 0 \land \\
    & & & \forall x \in [65, 90]: u(x) - \mu_2(-1) > 0 \big ) \,,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu_1(a) = (400x + a) \cdot 10^{-3}$ and $\mu_2(a) = (200x + a) \cdot
10^{-3}$.
We solve \cref{pr:stl_bound_set} assuming the rod starts at rest (singleton
initial value $u_0^1 = 0,
u_0^2 = 0$) and the force $h_L$ is contained in the set $[\SI{1900}{\newton},
\SI{2100}{\newton}]$. We show in
\cref{fig:mech_plots_bounds} the bounds used for $\delta, \eta$ and $\nu$ for a
uniform mesh of size $h=5$ and time interval $\Delta t = \SI{1}{\milli\second}$. 
The trajectory for $h_L = \SI{2000}{\newton}$ for one period, 
along with the profiles used in the
specification $\phi$ are depicted in \cref{fig:mech_plots_trajectory}. 
The resulting MILP has 42033
variables, 8404 of them binary, and 50419 constraints. It took 5341 seconds to
solve it, resulting in a minimum robustness of 0.16, which means the
specification is satisfied.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we formulated and solved a verification problem for systems governed by a
PDE with specifications given in an extension to STL. Our solution relies
on the approximation of the PDE using the Finite Element Method, which reduces
the problem to the verification of a standard STL formula for a discrete-time
linear system. The reformulation requires perturbing the predicates in the
formula using the FEM approximation errors as well as the derivatives of the
approximated solution and the predicate functions. Finally, the final
verification problem is encoded as a MILP.

We implemented our method in Python and used Gurobi to solve the MILP. Our
results on a simple heat equation show an acceptable level of conservatism that
would allow us to verify a specification satisfied more robustly than a 6\% of the range of
the system. We were able to solve verification problems for sets of initial
values and boundary conditions in minutes on consumer hardware.

As future work, we want to find the bounds $\delta, \eta$ and $\nu$ in a
systematic way, either analytically or using a robust statistical method. We
also plan to formulate and solve control problems for PDEs under S-STL constraints
using a similar approach.
