We define the syntax and semantics of SMTL, and explore natural restrictions of the language to gain tractability. We also provide an algorithm for finding a schedule to a problem specified as an SMTL formula, and establish a novel equivalence between a fragment of MTL and simple temporal networks, a widely-used formalism in AI temporal planning.},

This text elucidates the method's broader scope, bridging the gap between mathematical foundations and practical applications. Intended for students as well as professionals, it is an excellent companion for independent study, with numerous illustrative examples and problems.The authors trace the method's development and explain the technique in clearly understandable stages. Topics include solving problems involving partial differential equations, with a thorough finite element analysis of Poisson's equation; a step-by-step assembly of the master matrix; various numerical techniques for solving large systems of equations; and applications to problems in elasticity and the bending of beams and plates. Additional subjects include general interpolation functions, numerical integrations, and higher-order elements; applications to second- and fourth-order partial differential equations; and a variety of issues involving elastic vibrations, heat transfer, and fluid flow. The displacement model is fully developed, in addition to the hybrid model, of which Dr. Tong was an originator. The text concludes with numerous helpful appendixes.},

Our algorithm has complexity linear in both the size of the specification and the size of the global state graph for the concurrent system. We also show how this approach can be adapted to handle fairness. We argue that our technique can provide a practical alternative to manual proof construction or use of a mechanical theorem prover for verifying many finite-state concurrent systems. Experimental results show that state machines with several hundred states can be checked in a matter of seconds.},

The algorithm is geared towards being used in model checking in an ``on-the-fly'' fashion, that is the automaton can be constructed simultaneously with, and guided by, the generation of the model. In particular, it is possible to detect that a property does not hold by only constructing part of the model and of the automaton. The algorithm can also be used to check the validity of a temporal logic assertion. Although the general problem is PSPACE-complete, experiments show that our algorithm performs quite well on the temporal formulas typically encountered in verification. While basing linear-time temporal logic model-checking upon a transformation to automata is not new, the details of how to do this efficiently, and in ``on-the-fly'' fashion have never been given.},

Combined with an appropriate strategy for exploring the parameter space, this technique can be used to guide simulation-based verification of complex nonlinear and hybrid systems against temporal properties.
